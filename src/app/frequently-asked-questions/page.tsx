          <p>
            Find My Uro is a website that lets the community both support their urologist and help other fellow patients discover urologists that
            other patients like. It is a comprehensive Urologist review and search platform, powered by reviews from patients. We developed this after
            hearing from our Kidney stone patient community about the need to find good urologists.

          <p className="text-lg font-bold">What is Vouching?</p>
          <p>
            Vouching is a gesture that mimics the way patients support their urologists on the Worst Pain Ever community and on social media. For
            example, when other community members ask for suggestions, some members will chime in with their own urologists on social media and forum
            threads. Vouching hopes to capture the spirit of this recommendation. You can vouch for the same Urologist more than once.

          <p className="text-lg font-bold">What is an Award?</p>
          <p>
            An award is provided to Users that vouch for their Urologists, and there are various versions - from being the first 10 to vouch, to
            having your vouch viewed and used by other Kidney stone patients. It is our way of showing our appreciation to the community for sharing
            their experience.
